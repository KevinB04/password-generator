## Credits

I'm very grateful for the help of the following people:

Corey Yates, my tutor, has been an enormous help in guiding me through the process of understanding how to create a working application. My instructor and TAs helped lay the ground work for me to create this project and are encouraging on a daily basis. A special thanks goes to my classmate John Erler for helping me out in a study session of ours and helping everything make more sense.
